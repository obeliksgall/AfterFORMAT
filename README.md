# AfterFORMAT
Script that saves me time after reinstalling Windows.

The script uses WinGet and Chocolatey to download and install the packages I use.
If there is something missing (id packages do not exist in Winet or Chocolatey), you will be redirected to the page to download the installation file


Paste this command into Powershell (admin):

iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://bit.ly/3oWfw26'))

Or

iwr -useb https://bit.ly/3oWfw26 | iex
