# AfterFORMAT
Script that saves me time after reinstalling Windows.

The script uses WinGet to download and install the packages I use.
If there is something missing, you will be redirected to the page to download the installation file


Paste this command into Powershell (admin):

iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://bit.ly/3oWfw26'))

Or

iwr -useb https://bit.ly/3oWfw26 | iex
